# Overview
Quizzical lets users answer random trivia questions from [Open Triva DB](https://opentdb.com/api.php).

This is a project from the [Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) from Scrimba.

## Scrimba project requirements
- Two screens (start & questions)
- Pull 5 questions from the OTDB API
- Tally correct answers after 'check answers' is clicked
- Styled & polish

## Extra features I added
- Show `loading` element when trivia questions are not ready yet (still being fetched from API)
- User must answer all questions to check answers. If they don't, a message will show up to tell them to.

## What I learnt
- Custom hooks
- Conditional rendering

## Problems I encountered
### How to deploy a react app onto github pages
- Scrimba focuses on teaching us to write code but didnâ€™t quite go in depth on how to get our work online.
- In trying to figure this out, I learned how to
    - use visual studio code
    - how to use the terminal to execute commands
    - how to create a react app using the`create-react-app` package
    - how to create a react app using viteJS instead (I went with this option because the setup was much faster)
    - Although naming files as `.js` was fine on the scrimba environment, I had to rename the files to `.jsx` for deployment.
